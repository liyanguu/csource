<h1>10 words coined in the si-fi universe</h1>

<h2>robotics</h2>
<p class="sound">[roh-bot-iks]</p>
<p>

while the noun <em>robotics</em> is commonplace today, it wasn't back in the 1941 when sci-fi writer issas asimov coined the term in a short story published in astounding science fiction. it took another 20 years before the term really took off, and by the 1980s, <em>robotics</em> had firmly planted itself in the english language. the term <em>robot</em> entered english in 1923 from a translation of karel capek's 1920 play called rossum's universal robots. it came to english from czech base <em>robot-</em>, as found in the words <em>robota</em> meaning "compulsory labor" and <em>robotnik</em> meaning "worker".

<h2>Time Travel</h2>
<p>

While <em>time travel</em> has been considered since as early as The Mahabharata, H. G. Wells gave the English language much-used terminology on the subject. In 1894 Wells coined terms related to <em>time travel</em> such as <em>time travelling</em> and <em>time traveller </em> in his story with the heading "Time Travelling: Possibility or Paradox." A year later, in his novella The Time Machine, Wells explores <em>time travel</em> in more detail as an unnamed protagonist moves backwards and forwards in time, encountering the mythical species of the Eloi and the Morlocks on his way.

<h2>zero g</h2>
<p>

<em>zero gravity</em> was coined by author c.clarke in sands of mars, his first science-fiction novel. a year later, he coined the term <em>zero g</em>, where g is short for "gravity", in his novel islands in the sky. <em>zero gravity</em> is the condition in which the apparent effect of gravity is zero, and objects float if they aren't tied down to something larger and more sturdy, like the wall of a spaceship. this concept of <em>zero g</em> became official terminology of astronauts as the space race accelerated in the 1960s, and today, it's viewed more as a science term then a sci-fi term.

<h2>warp speed</h2>
<p>

if you are travelling in a spacecraft at a speed faster than light, you're moving at <em>warp speed</em>. the word <em>warp</em> comes from the old english <em>wearp</em> which refers to threads running over fabric. in the 20th century, it became popular to conceptualize space and its relation to time as a fabric. the first usage of <em>warp</em> in relation to speed was in a 1968 <em>star trek</em> script, "all our yesterdays." since its debut in english, <em>warp speed</em> has taken on metaphorical senses outside the realm of space.

<h2>nanotechnology</h2>
<p class="sound">[nan-uh-tek-nol-uh-jee, ney-nuh]</p>
<p>
<em>nanites</em>, or tiny robots built on small scale, were a concept first realized in science fiction and later researched by scientists in the hopes of making these minute robots a reality. sometimes called <em>nanomachines</em>, <em>nanorobots</em>, or <em>nanobots</em>, these robots will one day have many real-life applications, including targeted drug delivery in patients with cancer. perhaps one of the first science fiction writers to imagine <em>nanotechnology</em> was nikolai leskov, whose 1881 story described imperceptible robots, requiring 5,000,000 times magnification to be seen.
